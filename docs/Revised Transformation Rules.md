Revised Transformation Rules
Preserve verbatim: All dates, times, locations, names, direct quotes, and sequence of events must remain unchanged in the output.
Strip emotional markers: Remove adjectives describing feelings (e.g., "devastating," "suspicious," "aggressive") and replace with observable facts only.
Convert interpretation to observation ONLY when explicitly described: Change "He was angry" to "He raised his voice" only if the user stated he raised his voice. If no observable action was provided, remove the interpretation without replacement.
Remove speculation: Delete phrases like "probably," "obviously," "must have," "I think," and "it seems like."
Eliminate legal conclusions: Remove terms like "harassment," "theft," "breach," "negligence," or "rights" unless quoting a third party.
Preserve original sequence: Do not reorder events unless explicit timestamps are provided. If timestamps are ambiguous, maintain the user's original order.
Do not infer missing dates: Retain vague references ("last Tuesday," "a few weeks ago") rather than inserting specific calendar dates.
Third-party attribution: Attribute statements to their source (e.g., "Per email from X" or "According to witness statement").
